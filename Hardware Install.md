# Pi Control

## Hardware Installation

## Warning!!! Installing the Pi Control Board on the incorrect pins on the Pi can damage your Pi!

### Pi Control Kit with NFC contents

### Pi Control Kit without NFC contents

These kits shown use the Style B USB Port which may require the tweaked bottom shell design.

### Intsallation Steps

  1. Glue front control panel into the bottom shell.

  2. Insert USB extender with printed spacer into lower USB Port of the Pi.

  3. Wrap the ribbon cable underneath the Pi.

   * The ribbon cable should hug the edge of the PCB snugly for the best fit.

  4. Slip the Pi and front USB Port into the bottom shell (the SD card needs to be removed when installing and removing the Pi from the shell. (Glue the from USB port into place)

  5. Connect the front control panel, NFC, and Fan Harness to the Pi Control Board. Each connector only plugs in one way, be gentle.

   * If using the slim 30mm fan mount I designed, you will need to remove the white printed support trim from around the top mounted connectors. It is there to give the connectors support while inserting the wire harnesses and is not necessary.
   
  6. Place the Pi Control Board into position
  
   * Be sure to insert the Pi Control board into the right most pins of the Pi
   * Check clearance between heatsinks and bottom of Pi Control board. If necessary remove white printed support trim from top mounted connectors or remove heatsink. If heatsink is too tall and touches any of the circuitry or exposed pads underneath Pi Control board you will need to use a shorter heatsink or none at all.

### NFC Installs - Cart Tray 

  8. If using the embedded NFC cart tray (highly recommended for best fitmet of kit) insert the NFC through the bottom of the tray.

  9. Snap conver into place.

  10. Insert cart tray into top shell. It should flex enough to get one side in and then the other.

  10. Careful routing of the NFC harness between the two usb ports on the Pi as shown will result in the best fitment and pivot operation.

   Suggested placement of the NFC if you are not using the embedded NFC cart try. It is a tight fit in the case. Suggestion to try gluing this in lightly and testing fitment before commiting to  placement. Test "barbantia" latching operation.
